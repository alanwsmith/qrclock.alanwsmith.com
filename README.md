## Overview

I wanted to see what would happen if you
encoded time into a QR code. This is it.

## Assets

For reference, I'm using the module:

https://www.npmjs.com/package/qrcode

I made the GIF myself.

## Framework

I did this when I was first learning about Next.js. 
These days, I'd just make a vanially page for this one
since there's so little too it.
